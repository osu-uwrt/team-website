        <p class="text-justify ">The Underwater Robotics Team represents a unique niche in the local community.  The team engages in the community by participating in events such as the Ohio State Fair.  As a participant in the Ohio State Fair, the Underwater Robotics Team designs and builds an exhibit to educate the local community about marine engineering.  This involves smaller ROVs which guests can actively control and engage with in a small pool.  The past year, electromagnets were attached to these smaller ROVs and guests were challenged to pick up painted washers from the bottom of the pool.  This entertained many guests; both young and old.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Although not a quantifiable metric, the joy the exhibit brought to everyone was a rewarding experience, engaging teachers and encouraging them to incorporate the aspects of underwater vehicular design to their classroom.  We have even engaged younger interested individuals with special needs to encourage them to pursue their underwater interests!</p>

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">The team also participates in Ohio State camps hosted by Women in Engineering (WiE) as mentors and judges for the ROV camps to engage young adults in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.  The team has a firm belief that STEM education is an important initiative.  The Underwater Robotics Team hopes to continue to make a local impact on STEM education through both participating in community events and with proper funding, sponsoring technology demonstrations of the team’s ROVS as a part of OSGC’s larger initiative.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">This year, the team participated in two events – one was a semester long high school project using Sea Perch kits. The teams had to navigate through an obstacle course, and the local competition. Shown in Figure 1 is a picture of the winning team with the collegiate mentors.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">The second activity was a year long activity at a local middle school. The team helped mentor middle school students via the use of Arduinos. During the first half of the school year, the primary focus was teaching the students the Arduino programming language. As shown in Figure 2, a member of the team is shown students a quadcopter – one of they many applications of robotics. During the second half of the year, the students were given the task of designing and programming a line following robot. Figure 3, shows an example of the vehicle on the competition track.</p>

        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">The team has volunteered at multiple STEM events hosted by the PAST Foundation. The events are ROV competitions for high school students in the Columbus area and require the creation of a tethered underwater vehicle, technical documentation, and a formal presentation. Team members have been involved with assisting in overall event flow, acting as judges for presentations and documentation, and supporting teams waiting for the run. In preparation for one of PAST’s competitions team members also volunteered as mentors for an engineering class at METRO high school, where volunteers helped teams troubleshoot issues and gave design advice.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">For future STEM outreach activities the team has created a small demonstration robot, termed a STEMbot. This vehicle will be used in classrooms and workshops to show people how great the STEM field is and hopefully inspire young minds to pursue science and engineering careers.</p>
